HOW TO GET NETGEAR WNDA3100v2 to work

cd into the ndiswrapper directory and run this:

make
sudo make install

These commands may require that ndiswrapper-common or some other package
is installed first, I'm really not sure.

Then use ndiswrapper to load the driver:

sudo ndiswrapper -i gutil/netgear_wnda3100v2/driver/bcmn43xx64.inf
sudo depmod -a
sudo modprobe ndiswrapper
sudo ndiswrapper -m

After this it should work, but don't move the files! You will break it!
